      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">AI Finance and Tax Assistant</h2>

      <p className="mt-4">
        The <strong>AI Finance and Tax Assistant</strong> is designed to
        streamline the evaluation and approval process for tax incentives,
        reliefs, and waivers within the ministry. It automates application
        processing, generates concise summaries, and facilitates document
        submission for ministerial approval. Additionally, it features an
        AI-powered chatbot that enables ministry officials to query and retrieve
        information from submitted applications, providing quick insights into
        an organization’s tax incentive or relief history. This enhances
        decision-making efficiency and ensures a smoother approval workflow.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Key Features</h3>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The assistant handles the entire process of applying for tax incentives
        or relief, starting from receiving the organization&apos;s letter,
        generating summaries, and facilitating communication with the ministry.
        The chatbot functionality helps address any questions regarding the
        organization&apos;s application, providing a better understanding for
        the ministry during the review process. The assistant can also generate
        a sample letter based on whether the ministry approves or rejects the
        application.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Application Process</h3>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The assistant is built to handle the application process efficiently.
        When an organization submits an application for a tax incentive, relief,
        or waiver, it is processed in the following steps:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
        <li>Receives the organization&apos;s letter of application.</li>
        <li>
          Generates a summary of the application, outlining the incentive,
          relief, or waiver requested, and the reasons for the application.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sends the generated summary and supporting documents to the relevant
          ministry for review and approval.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Chatbot Functionality</h3>
      <p className="mt-4">
        A built-in chatbot helps facilitate communication between the
        organization and the ministry. After an application is submitted, the
        chatbot can answer questions to help the ministry better understand the
        organization&apos;s request. It provides further context about the
        organization&apos;s offer and their expected benefits upon receiving the
        tax incentive, relief, or waiver.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
        <li>
          Answers questions related to the organization&apos;s background and
          reasons for applying for tax benefits.
        </li>
        <li>
          Offers additional details on the organization&apos;s projected
          outcomes after receiving approval for incentives or waivers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Sample Letter Generation</h3>
      <p className="mt-4">
        After the ministry has reviewed the application, the assistant generates
        a sample response letter in Bahasa, based on the decision to approve or
        reject the application. The letter includes the decision and the
        reasoning provided by the ministry. This generated letter helps
        streamline the communication process between the ministry and the
        applying organization.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Technical Implementation</h3>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The system is implemented using <strong>LangChain</strong> to process
        and manage the documents and queries. Here&apos;s how it functions
        technically:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Document Ingestion:</strong> The organization&apos;s
          application letter is processed and ingested using LangChain, which
          passes the document to a large language model (LLM) for summarization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Chatbot Integration:</strong> The chatbot is designed to allow
          the user to query the ingested document, using LangChain&apos;s
          embedding models to generate responses related to the
          application&apos;s content and the organization’s tax relief request.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sample Letter Generation:</strong> After the application is
          approved or rejected by the ministry, LangChain is used to generate a
          response letter in Bahasa based on the ministry&apos;s decision,
          ensuring the language and tone of the letter match the official
          requirements.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6">Conclusion</h3>
      <p className="mt-4">
        The AI Finance and Tax Assistant helps organizations efficiently apply
        for tax incentives, reliefs, or waivers by automating the generation of
        summaries, facilitating communication through a chatbot, and producing
        response letters in Bahasa based on ministry decisions. The technical
        implementation ensures that documents are processed accurately, and
        responses are generated efficiently, making the application process more
        streamlined and reducing the administrative burden on both the
        organizations and the ministry.
